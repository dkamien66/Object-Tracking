### Object-Tracking

# What
The code in this project is NOT of my creation, all credit goes to Pysource "Object Tracking from scratch with OpenCV and Python" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgGro5IV-cs.

# Why
I was interested in how object tracking was coded using a computer program. I discovered OpenCV, a Python library for computer vision, and came upon Pysource's tutorial video above. I followed through the making of code and added my own comments to help facilite my understanding of using OpenCV and other object tracking technologies. OpenCV can be a powerful imaging tool to capture motion and information.
